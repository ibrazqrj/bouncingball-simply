<b>📋 Description</b>
---
Explore the realm of animation with this captivating Processing sketch that brings a bouncing ball to life! This project showcases basic animation principles by animating a ball's movement around the canvas and simulating its bouncing off the walls. Let's unravel the magic of the code:

🎨 Setup
---
The canvas is sized to 800x600 pixels in the setup() function to provide ample space for the animation.

🖌️ Drawing
---
Within the draw() function, the animation is rendered with a gray background (RGB 80) and a circular ball with a diameter of 50 pixels centered at the position specified by posX and posY.

🚀 Animation
---
The ball's motion is controlled by updating its position (posX and posY) with the values of speedX and speedY respectively. The ball's trajectory is altered as it bounces off the edges of the canvas.

🔄 Bouncing Logic
---
- Upon collision with the right edge, the ball's horizontal speed (speedX) is reversed, causing it to bounce off the right wall.
- Similarly, when the ball collides with the left edge, its horizontal speed is reversed, and then doubled for an exaggerated bounce effect.
- The bouncing behavior is replicated for collisions with the top and bottom edges of the canvas.

🚀 How to Run
---
- Ensure that you have Processing installed on your system.
- Copy the provided code into a new Processing sketch.
- Execute the sketch, and behold the mesmerizing dance of the bouncing ball as it traverses the canvas.
